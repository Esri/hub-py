Currently, Channels and Posts are related by a simple one-to-many relationship, where a channel may have many posts and a post belongs to a single channel.

    "#### Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "A Channel represents a unique platform sharing configuration, comprised of a distinct set of values for access, groups, and orgs. Channels are related to an ArcGIS Online user through their portal organization and group memberships, and subsequently the Channel model tracks closely with the platform sharing ACL.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 varieties of channels that can be created:\n",
    "- Team Channel - access is private and groups array contains a single platform groupId\n",
    "- Shared Channel - access is private and there are multiple platform groupIds in the groups array\n",
    "- Org Channel - access is limited to members of the configured orgs\n",
    "- Public Channel - Can be viewed by everyone but is configured with the org value of creator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Posts\n",
    "A Post is the primary forum for dialogue between users in a Channel. Posts are organized into \"threads\" using a self-join: a Post can have many replies, or a Post can belong to a Parent Post. Posts are required to have a body, and optionally a title (perhaps best suited for parent posts). A Post also has a status, which affect the visibility of a post and values such as \"pending\", \"approved\", or \"rejected\" serve as an early mechanism for moderation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Posts can also relate to platform content such as items, datasets, and groups via the discussion attribute. This attribute is a URI-formatted string. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- *hub://dataset/4ef_1?id=4&attribute=species* encodes that a post was made in the Hub application about dataset 4ef, layer _1, feature 4's species attribute. \n",
    "- *urban://item/1b4* encodes that a post was made in Urban about plan 1bf. Perhaps the author of the post has a critique of the plan at large.\n"
