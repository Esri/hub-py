Without Customer's permission, Esri will not access, use, or disclose Customer Content except as reasonably necessary to support Customer's use of Online Services, respond to Customer's requests for customer support, or troubleshoot Customer's subscription or for any other purpose authorized by Customer in writing. If Customer accesses Online Services with an application provided by a third party, Esri may disclose Customer Content to such third party as necessary to enable interoperation between the application, Online Services, and Customer Content. Esri may disclose Customer Content if required to do so by law or regulation or by order of a court or other government body, in which case Esri will reasonably attempt to limit the scope of disclosure. It is Customer's sole responsibility to ensure that Customer Content is suitable for use with Online Services and for maintaining regular offline backups using the Online Services export and download capabilities.
b.     Sharing Customer Content. If Customer elects to share Customer Content using Sharing Tools, then Customer acknowledges that Customer has enabled third parties to use, store, cache, copy, reproduce, (re)distribute, and (re)transmit Customer Content through Online Services. Esri is not responsible for any loss, deletion, modification, or disclosure of Customer Content resulting from use or misuse of Sharing Tools or Online Services, Online Content, ArcGIS Website, Documentation, or related materials. Customer's use of Sharing Tools is at Customer's sole risk.
c.     Retrieving Customer Content upon Termination. Upon termination of the Agreement or any trial, evaluation, or subscription, Esri will make Customer Content available to Customer for download for a period of 30 days unless Customer requests a shorter window of availability or Esri is legally prohibited from doing so. Thereafter, Customer's right to access or use Customer Content with Online Services will end, and Esri will have no further obligations to store or return Customer Content.
 
3.8 Limits on Use of Online Services; Service Credits. Each Online Services subscription includes Service Credits as described in the applicable Ordering Document. Each Service Credit entitles Customer to consume a set amount of Online Services, the amount varying depending on the Online Services that Customer is using. As Customer consumes Online Services, Service Credits are automatically debited from Customer's subscription, up to the maximum number of Service Credits available. Customer may purchase additional Service Credits as needed. Esri will notify Customer's subscription account administrator when Customer's Service consumption reaches approximately 75% of the Service Credits allocated to Customer through Customer's subscription. Esri reserves the right to suspend Customer's access to Online Services that consume Service Credits when Customer consumes all its Service Credits.

ARTICLE 7—SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE
 
7.1 Security. Esri publishes its security capabilities at http://doc.arcgis.com/en/trust/security/security-overview.htm. Customer may give Esri personnel access to Customer systems or to Customer or third-party personal information if access is essential for Esri's performance of Services and if Esri expressly agrees to such access. Esri will use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect such data and guard against unauthorized access. Customer bears responsibility to (i) confirm that Esri's published security and privacy controls meet all applicable legal requirements for protection of Customer Content and (ii) upload or share controlled Customer Content through Cloud Services only when it is legal to do so. Esri is not responsible to review Customer Content to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For US federal government customers, Online Services are FISMA Low authorized but do not meet higher security requirements including those found in DFARS 252.239-7010. Alternative solutions that meet these or similar requirements are available.
 
7.2 Malicious Code. Esri will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Esri Offerings will not transmit any Malicious Code to Customer. Esri is not responsible for Malicious Code that Customer introduces to Esri Offerings or that is introduced through third-party Content.
 
7.3 Export Compliance. Each party will comply with all applicable export laws and regulations, including the US Department of Commerce's Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the US Department of State's International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), and other applicable export laws. Customer will not export, reexport, transfer, release, or otherwise dispose of, in whole or in part, or permit access, transfer, or use of Services or Esri Offerings to any United States embargoed countries or denied entities or persons except in accordance with all then-current applicable US government export laws and regulations. Customer will not export, reexport, transfer, or use Services or Esri Offerings for certain missile, nuclear, chemical, or biological activities or end uses without proper authorization from the US government. Customer shall immediately notify Esri in writing if any US government entity or agency denies, suspends, or revokes Customer's export privileges. Customer will not upload, store, or process in Cloud Services any Customer Content that (i) has an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) other than EAR99 or (ii) is controlled for export from the United States under ITAR. Customer will notify Esri in advance if Esri's performance of any Services or provision of any Esri Offerings is related to any defense article, defense service, or technical data, as defined under the ITAR Sections 120.6, 120.9, and 120.10 respectively; Esri will not perform any such Services or provide any such Esri Offerings until Esri obtains any necessary export license from the US government. Customer will reasonably assist Esri in applying and obtaining an export license if needed.
 
ARTICLE 8—CLOUD SERVICES
 
8.1 Prohibited Uses. Customer may not access or use Cloud Services to
 
a.     Spam, spoof, or phish email; transmit junk email or offensive or defamatory material; or stalk or make threats of physical harm;
b.     Store or transmit any Malicious Code;
c.     Violate any law or regulation;
d.     Infringe or misappropriate the rights of any third party;
e.     Probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of Cloud Services or breach any security or authentication measures used by Cloud Services; or
f.      Benchmark the availability, performance, or functionality of Cloud Services for competitive purposes.
 
8.2 Service Interruption. System failures or other events beyond Esri's reasonable control may interrupt Customer's access to Cloud Services. Esri may not be able to provide advance notice of such interruptions.
 
8.3 Removal of Customer Content. Esri may remove or delete any portions of Customer Content if there is reason to believe that uploading Customer Content to, or using it with, Cloud Services materially violates this Agreement. If reasonable under these circumstances, Esri will notify Customer before removing Customer Content. Esri will respond to any Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notices in accordance with Esri's copyright policy, available at http://www.esri.com/legal/dmca_policy.
 
8.4 Service Suspension. Esri may suspend access to Cloud Services (i) if Customer materially breaches this Agreement and fails to timely cure the breach; (ii) if Esri reasonably believes that Customer's use of Cloud Services will subject Esri to immediate liability or adversely affect the integrity, functionality, or usability of the Cloud Services; (iii) for scheduled maintenance; (iv) to enjoin a threat or attack on Cloud Services; or (v) if Cloud Services become prohibited by law or regulated to a degree that continuing to provide them would impose a commercial hardship. When feasible, Esri will notify Customer of any Cloud Services suspension beforehand and give Customer reasonable opportunity to take remedial action.
 
Esri is not responsible for any damage, liabilities, or losses that may result from any interruption or suspension of Cloud Services or removal of Customer's content as described above.
 
8.5 Notice to Esri. Customer will promptly notify Esri if Customer becomes aware of any unauthorized use of Customer's subscription or any other breach of security regarding Cloud Services.
 
ARTICLE 9—GENERAL PROVISIONS

9.3 Patents. Customer may not seek, and may not permit any other user to seek, a patent or similar right worldwide that is based on or incorporates any Products. This express prohibition on patenting will not apply to Customer's software and technology except to the extent that Products, or any portion thereof, are part of any claim or preferred embodiment in a patent application or a similar application.
 
9.4 Restrictions on Solicitation. Neither party will solicit for hire any employee of the other party who is associated with the performance of Services during the performance of the Services and for a period of 1 year thereafter. This does not restrict either party from publicly advertising positions for hire in newspapers, professional magazines, or Internet postings.
 
9.5 Taxes and Fees; Shipping Charges. Fees that Esri quotes to Customer are exclusive of any and all applicable taxes or fees, including, but not limited to, sales tax, use tax, or value-added tax (VAT); customs, duties, or tariffs; and shipping and handling charges.

9.6 Compliance Review. Customer will keep accurate and complete records and accounts pertaining to its compliance with its obligations under this Agreement. Esri or its authorized distributor may conduct a compliance review of these records and accounts with no less than 14 business days' written notice, or may appoint an independent third party to conduct such a compliance review on its behalf. Customer will promptly correct any noncompliance identified during the compliance review. Neither Esri nor Esri's distributor may conduct a compliance review of Customer within 12 months after the conclusion of any prior compliance review that does not reveal any material Customer noncompliance.
 
9.7 No Implied Waivers. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement is not a waiver of the provisions or of the right of such party thereafter to enforce that or any other provision.
 
9.8 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, (a) such provision will be reformed only to the extent necessary to make the intent of the language enforceable, and (b) all other provisions of this Agreement remain in effect.
 
9.9 Successor and Assigns. Customer will not assign, sublicense, or transfer Customer's rights or delegate Customer's obligations under this Agreement without Esri's and its authorized distributor's prior written consent, and any attempt to do so without consent will be void. This Agreement will be binding on the respective successors and assigns of the parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding, a contractor under contract to the government to deliver Products may assign this Agreement and Products acquired for delivery to its government customer upon written notice to Esri, provided the government customer assents to the terms of this Agreement.
 
9.10 Survival of Terms. The Glossary of Terms and provisions of the following Articles of these General Terms and Conditions will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement: "Limited Warranties and Disclaimers," "Limitation of Liability," "Indemnifications" and "General Provisions".

If Customer is a US government entity or US government contractor, Esri licenses or provides subscriptions to Customer in accordance with this Agreement under FAR Subparts 12.211/12.212 or DFARS Subpart 227.7202. Esri Data and Online Services are licensed or subscribed under the same DFARS Subpart 227.7202 policy as commercial computer software for acquisitions made under DFARS. Products are subject to restrictions, and this Agreement strictly governs Customer's use, modification, performance, reproduction, release, display, or disclosure of Products. Agreement provisions that are inconsistent with federal law regulation will not apply. A US government Customer may transfer Software to any of its facilities to which it transfers the computer(s) on which it has installed such Software. If any court, arbitrator, or board holds that a US government Customer has greater rights to any portion of the Products under applicable public procurement law, such rights will extend only to the portions affected.
 
9.12 Governing Law. This Agreement is not subject to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
 
a.     Government Entities. If Customer is a government entity, the applicable laws of Customer's jurisdiction govern this Agreement.

9.13 Dispute Resolution. The parties will use the following dispute resolution processes:
 
a.     Equitable Relief. Either party will have the right to seek an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without the requirement of posting a bond or proving injury as a condition for relief.
b.     US Government Agencies. This Agreement is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 USC 601–613).
c.     Other Government Entities. Esri will comply with mandatory dispute resolutions under applicable law.
d.     Arbitration. Except as noted above, the parties will submit to binding arbitration to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement that cannot be settled through negotiation. If Customer is in the United States or one of its territories or outlying areas, the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association will govern the arbitration proceedings. If Customer is outside the United States, the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce will govern the proceedings. The parties will select a single arbitrator in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules. The language of the arbitration will be English. Arbitration will be at an agreed-upon location. Either party will, at the request of the other, make available documents or witnesses relevant to the major aspects of the dispute.
 
9.14 Force Majeure. A party will not be liable for any failure of or delay in the performance of this Agreement for the period that such failure or delay is due to causes beyond the party's reasonable control. Such causes may include, but are not limited to, acts of God, war, strikes, labor disputes, cyber attacks, laws, regulations, government orders, or any other force majeure event.
 
9.15 Independent Contractor. Esri is and at all times will be an independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement creates an employer/employee, principal/agent, or joint venture relationship between Esri or its authorized distributor and Customer.
